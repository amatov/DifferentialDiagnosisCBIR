###  ** Reverse Image Search / Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) **

#### Presentations and clinical applications based on this algorithm are available here: https://researchgate.net/publication/374166145_Matov_Resume_2023

#####  Based on the feature descriptors generated by the scale-invariant feature transform and the bag-of-words model (BoW), it performs reverse image search. 

##### Content-based image retrieval query is accomplished via ElasticSearch using ranking based on a k-means clustering algorithm.
