#### Python code I wrote to implement a Reverse Image Search / Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)

#### Presentations and clinical applications based on my real-time algorithms are available here:

#####  Based on the feature descriptors generated by the scale-invariant feature transform and the bag-of-words model (BoW), it performs reverse image search. 

##### Content-based image retrieval query is accomplished via ElasticSearch using ranking based on a k-means clustering algorithm.
