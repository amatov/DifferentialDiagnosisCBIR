### Python code I wrote to implement a Reverse Image Search / Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)

####  Based on the feature descriptors generated by the scale-invariant feature transform and the bag-of-words model (BoW), it performs reverse image search. 

#### Content-based image retrieval query is accomplished via ElasticSearch using ranking based on a k-means clustering algorithm.

### See my preliminary demo of the BoW ranking at: https://vimeo.com/365998906/e94e02a8af
